Sharing Files

knowledge

1.In all cases, the only secure way to offer a file from your app to another app is to send the receiving app the file's content URI and grant temporary access permissions to that URI. 
	Content URIs with temporary URI access permissions are secure because they apply only to the app that receives the URI, and they expire automatically. 
	The Android FileProvider component provides the method getUriForFile() for generating a file's content URI.
	The FileProvider class is part of the v4 Support Library.
