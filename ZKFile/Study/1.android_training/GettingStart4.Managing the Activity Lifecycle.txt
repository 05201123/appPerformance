Managing the Activity Lifecycle
knowledge
1.Within the lifecycle callback methods, you can declare how your activity behaves when the user leaves and re-enters the activity. 
	For example, if you're building a streaming video player, you might pause the video and terminate the network connection when the user switches to another app. 
	When the user returns, you can reconnect to the network and allow the user to resume the video from the same spot.

2.While the activity's first lifecycle callback is onCreate(), its very last callback is onDestroy().
The system calls this method on your activity as the final signal that your activity instance is being completely removed from the system memory.

3.In some cases, such as when your activity operates as a temporary decision maker to launch another activity, you might call finish() from within onCreate() to destroy the activity. 
In this case, the system immediately calls onDestroy() without calling any of the other lifecycle methods.
