Building a Dynamic UI with Fragments

knowledge

1.The SharedPreferences APIs are only for reading and writing key-value pairs and you should not confuse them with the Preference APIs, which help you build a user interface for your app settings 
	(although they use SharedPreferences as their implementation to save the app settings). 
	For information about using the Preference APIs, see the Settings guide.
