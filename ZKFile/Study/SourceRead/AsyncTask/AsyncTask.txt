AsyncTask
 1.usage
	AsyncTasks should ideally be used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.) If you need to keep threads running for long periods of time,
	it is highly recommended you use the various APIs provided by the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> pacakge such as {@link Executor},{@link ThreadPoolExecutor} and {@link FutureTask}
 
 2.progress show
	publishProgress（Integer progress）
	protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... progress)

 3.Threading rules
	There are a few threading rules that must be followed for this class to work properly:
	（1）The AsyncTask class must be loaded on the UI thread
	（2）{@link #execute} must be invoked on the UI thread.
	（3）Do not call {@link #onPreExecute()}, {@link #onPostExecute},{@link #doInBackground}, {@link #onProgressUpdate} manually.
	（4）The task can be executed only once (an exception will be thrown if a second execution is attempted.)
