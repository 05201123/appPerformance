WebView	
knowledge
1.WebView extends android.widget.AbsoluteLayout
2.WebView的使用场景：
	WebView 最佳使用场景：仅展示一个html网页，基本不产生与用户的互动，就是一个view。
	当然现在有 Hybrid的开发模式，H5大行其道，很快捷，但性能上始终和原生有差距。
	如果网页全屏，与native 业务上无啥联系，可以直接跳转到浏览器，去展示网页。
3.Webview

4.WebChromeClient :用于提供与前端交互的方法

5.WebViewClient	:用于提供webview，加载网页时的各个生命周期

6. WebSettings	:设置webview的参数。
	（1）Zoom
		To enable the built-in zoom, set WebSettings.setBuiltInZoomControls(boolean) (introduced in API level CUPCAKE).
		NOTE: Using zoom if either the height or width is set to WRAP_CONTENT may lead to undefined behavior and should be avoided.

7.Building web pages to support different screen densities
	Here's a summary of the features you can use to handle different screen densities:
	（1）The window.devicePixelRatio DOM property. The value of this property specifies the default scaling factor used for the current device. 
	For example, if the value of window.devicePixelRatio is "1.0", then the device is considered a medium density (mdpi) device and 
	default scaling is not applied to the web page; 
	if the value is "1.5", then the device is considered a high density device (hdpi) and the page content is scaled 1.5x; 
	if the value is "0.75", then the device is considered a low density device (ldpi) and the content is scaled 0.75x.
	（2）The -webkit-device-pixel-ratio CSS media query. Use this to specify the screen densities for which this style sheet is to be used. 
	The corresponding value should be either "0.75", "1", or "1.5", to indicate that the styles are for devices with low density, medium density, or high density screens, respectively. 
	For example:
		<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (-webkit-device-pixel-ratio:1.5)" href="hdpi.css" />
	The hdpi.css stylesheet is only used for devices with a screen pixel ration of 1.5, which is the high density pixel ratio.
8.HTML5 Video support
	In order to support inline HTML5 video in your application you need to have hardware acceleration turned on.
	为了在应用中支持html5的视频，需要开启硬件加速
9.Full screen support
	In order to support full screen — for video or other HTML content — 
	you need to set a WebChromeClient and implement both onShowCustomView(View, WebChromeClient.CustomViewCallback) and onHideCustomView().
	If the implementation of either of these two methods is missing then the web contents will not be allowed to enter full screen. 
	Optionally you can implement getVideoLoadingProgressView() to customize the View displayed whilst a video is loading.
10.HTML5 Geolocation API support
	For applications targeting Android N and later releases (API level > M) the geolocation api is only supported on secure origins such as https.
	For such applications requests to geolocation api on non-secure origins are automatically denied without invoking 
	the corresponding onGeolocationPermissionsShowPrompt(String, GeolocationPermissions.Callback) method.

11.Layout size （不理解）
	It is recommended to set the WebView layout height to a fixed value or to MATCH_PARENT instead of using WRAP_CONTENT. 
	When using MATCH_PARENT for the height none of the WebView's parents should use a WRAP_CONTENT layout height since that could result in incorrect sizing of the views.
	Setting the WebView's height to WRAP_CONTENT enables the following behaviors:
		The HTML body layout height is set to a fixed value. This means that elements with a height relative to the HTML body may not be sized correctly.
		For applications targeting KITKAT and earlier SDKs the HTML viewport meta tag will be ignored in order to preserve backwards compatibility.
		Using a layout width of WRAP_CONTENT is not supported. If such a width is used the WebView will attempt to use the width of the parent instead.


12.Note: If your targetSdkVersion is set to "18" or lower, WebView operates in "quirks mode" in order to avoid some of the behavior changes described below, 
as closely as possible—while still providing your app the performance and web standards upgrades. 
Beware, though, that single and narrow column layouts and default zoom levels are not supported at all on Android 4.4, 
and there may be other behavioral differences that have not been identified, so be sure to test your app on Android 4.4 or higher 
even if you keep your targetSdkVersion set to "18" or lower.   虽然没打看明白，应该是应该测试Android 4.4以上的版本

			

question
1.如果不在AndroidManifest.xml申请Internet permission的话，会正常加载静态网页吗？
	 String summary = "<html><body>You scored <b>192</b> points.</body></html>";
	webview.loadData(summary, "text/html", null);
2. 如何理解？When using MATCH_PARENT for the height 
	none of the WebView's parents should use a WRAP_CONTENT layout height 
	since that could result in incorrect sizing of the views.
